# Discovery and Implementation Plan: AKS Observability Stack & Jaeger Refactoring

**Document Title:** Discovery and Implementation Plan: AKS Observability Stack & Jaeger Refactoring  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** September 09, 2025  
**Author:** Oluwafemi - Femi  
**Status:** Draft for Review

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive discovery and implementation strategy for deploying a production-ready observability stack on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The primary focus is transitioning from proof-of-concept implementations to enterprise-grade solutions, with particular emphasis on refactoring Jaeger tracing from `allInOne` to `production` deployment strategy.

### Key Objectives
- Establish secure, scalable observability infrastructure
- Implement high-availability trace storage with data persistence
- Ensure proper RBAC and certificate management
- Minimize operational overhead through automation

---

## 2. Current State Assessment

### 2.1 Existing Infrastructure Status

| Component | Status | Configuration | Production Readiness |
|-----------|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| Certificate Management | ‚úÖ Complete | Self-signed (temporary) | Requires migration to official issuer |
| Ingress Controller | ‚úÖ Complete | NGINX Ingress | Production ready |
| RBAC & Group Sync | ‚úÖ Complete | Azure AD integration | Production ready |
| Jaeger Tracing | üîÑ In Progress | allInOne strategy | Requires refactoring |
| Elasticsearch Backend | ‚úÖ Complete | ECK Operator | Production ready |

### 2.2 Identified Risks
- **Data Loss Risk:** Current Jaeger `allInOne` uses in-memory storage
- **Scalability Limitations:** Monolithic deployment cannot scale components independently  
- **Namespace Configuration:** Deployment references non-existent namespace (`eddv-bld`)

---

## 3. Implementation Strategy

### 3.1 Shared Technology Components

#### 3.1.1 Certificate Management
- **Solution:** cert-manager with self-signed certificates (development)
- **Migration Path:** Transition to official certificate issuer for production
- **Pipeline Reference:** `devops/pipelines/setup/generate-aks-tls-certificates`

#### 3.1.2 Ingress Controller  
- **Solution:** NGINX Ingress Controller (`kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx`)
- **Rationale:** Mature, feature-rich, and aligns with existing technology stack

#### 3.1.3 Authentication & Authorization
- **Method:** Azure Active Directory (AAD) Integration
- **Configuration:** AKS cluster configured with `--aad-admin-group-object-ids`
- **Groups:** 
  - `aks-observability-admins` (cluster-admin access)
  - `aks-observability-viewers` (read-only access)

### 3.2 Jaeger Production Deployment

#### 3.2.1 Current State Limitations
The existing `allInOne` deployment presents several production concerns:

- **Data Persistence:** In-memory storage results in trace loss during pod restarts
- **Scalability:** Components cannot be scaled independently
- **High Availability:** Single point of failure architecture
- **Resource Efficiency:** Suboptimal resource utilization

#### 3.2.2 Target Architecture

**Deployment Strategy:** Production mode via Jaeger Operator

**Core Components:**
- **Agent:** Deployed as DaemonSet for trace collection
- **Collector:** Horizontally scalable trace ingestion layer  
- **Query Service:** Dedicated UI and API layer
- **Storage:** Elasticsearch cluster for persistence

**Storage Backend Configuration:**
- **Primary Storage:** Elasticsearch via ECK (Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes) Operator
- **Data Retention:** Configurable retention policies
- **Index Management:** Automated cleanup via es-index-cleaner CronJob (30-day default)

#### 3.2.3 Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Component | Status | Timeline |
|-------|-----------|---------|----------|
| 1 | Elasticsearch Setup | ‚úÖ Complete | - |
| 2 | Jaeger Operator Deployment | üîÑ In Progress | Week 1 |
| 3 | Production Configuration | üìã Pending | Week 2 |
| 4 | Index Cleanup Automation | üìã Pending | Week 2 |
| 5 | Namespace Resolution | ‚ö†Ô∏è Blocked | TBD |

## 4. Risk Mitigation

### 4.1 Technical Risks
- **Namespace Dependency:** Resolve `eddv-bld` namespace issue before deployment
- **Data Migration:** Plan for zero-downtime transition from current setup
- **Resource Allocation:** Ensure adequate cluster resources for production workloads

### 4.2 Operational Risks
- **Monitoring Blind Spots:** Implement observability for observability stack itself
- **Backup Strategy:** Define data backup and disaster recovery procedures
- **Access Control:** Validate RBAC configurations in non-production environment first
