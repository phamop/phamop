Could you confirm if you are experiencing any performance impact on the server following the recent upgrade?
Response: Yes, we are observing slowness.

Could you provide additional details about the upgrade task performed?
Please refer to the attached yum-note.txt file for details.
Key Notes:

The upgrade started at 10:22 AM (EST) and completed by 2:11 PM (EST).

At 11:09 AM (EST) (log line 33, timestamp 2025-04-21 15:09:26 UTC), the process was still ongoing.

The next recorded update was at 1:58 PM (EST) (2025-04-21T13:58:22-04:00).

Based on the timestamps, the backup alone took approximately 2 hours and 40 minutes.
Could you provide technical clarification on this duration?

What is the current status of the server?
The server is operational but continues to exhibit sluggish performance.

Were any changes made to the server prior to this issue?
No other modifications were made—the slowness began after the upgrade.

Please let us know if further details are required.

This guide provides a detailed implementation plan for integrating Azure Monitor Insights metrics with Grafana on an existing AKS cluster, using Azure Key Vault for secrets management and Azure DevOps pipelines for deployment.

## Prerequisites

- Existing AKS cluster
- Existing Azure Monitor workspace
- Existing Azure Key Vault (Goodvault)
- Azure DevOps organization
- Helm installed in your local environment

## Architecture Overview

1. Grafana deployed via Helm to AKS
2. Azure Monitor Metrics integration configured in Grafana
3. Secrets managed via Azure Key Vault
4. Separate Azure DevOps pipelines for:
   - Grafana deployment
   - Azure Monitor integration
5. Environment-specific configuration via parameter files

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Prepare Helm Charts

**Grafana Helm Chart Structure:**
```
grafana/
├── Chart.yaml
├── values.yaml
├── values-dev.yaml
├── values-prod.yaml
├── templates/
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   ├── service.yaml
│   ├── configmap.yaml
│   ├── secrets.yaml
│   └── ingress.yaml
└── crds/
    └── grafana-dashboards.yaml
```
