Decommission the  OSS observability stack  of FT/ DEV

Expected Outcome:
Remove OSS stack on both  DEV/FT environment

   
 Implementation Approach  


All OSS observability stack pods, deployments, statefulsets, and daemonsets are terminated and removed from the FT Kubernetes cluster.

AC2: All associated Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) and Persistent Volumes (PVs) storing time-series data and Grafana dashboards are permanently deleted.

AC3: All Kubernetes Services, Ingresses, and Network Policies for the OSS stack are removed.

AC4: Any dedicated namespaces (e.g., monitoring) are removed from the FT cluster, or confirmed empty of OSS resources.

Remove any custom resources (e.g., Servicemonitor, Podmonitor CRDs from Prometheus Operator).

Delete deployments/statefulsets to gracefully terminate the applications.

Delete services and ingresses.

Delete PVCs/PVs to release storage.

Finally, delete the namespace.
