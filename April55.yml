# User Story: OSS Stack Deployment for Observability

## User Story Statement
**As a** DevOps Engineer/Platform Team  
**I want to** deploy an Open Source Software (OSS) observability stack into Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) via Helm charts  
**So that** I can establish comprehensive logging, monitoring, and tracing capabilities for application observability

## Description
Deploy a complete OSS observability stack consisting of Loki (logging), Prometheus (metrics), Jaeger (tracing), and Grafana (visualization) into AKS. Configure OpenTelemetry Collector to integrate seamlessly with all components and modify the existing CI/CD pipeline to support the deployment process.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **OSS Stack Deployment**: Successfully deploy Loki, Prometheus, Jaeger, and Grafana into AKS using Helm charts
- [ ] **OpenTelemetry Integration**: Configure Otel-Collector to collect and route telemetry data to all observability components
- [ ] **Grafana Integration**: Integrate all components with the existing Grafana Observability pipeline for unified visualization
- [ ] **Environment Deployment**: Deploy OSS stack into FT (Functional Test) environment using Kustomize for environment-specific configurations
- [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**: Modify existing CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment and configuration process
- [ ] **Code Integration**: Successfully merge all changes to the main branch following proper review and approval process
- [ ] **Logging Functionality**: Verify that Loki is actively collecting and storing logs from applications for observability purposes
- [ ] **End-to-End Validation**: Confirm that metrics, logs, and traces are flowing correctly through the entire observability pipeline

## Implementation Approach
1. **Helm Chart Preparation**: Prepare and configure Helm charts for each OSS component (Loki, Prometheus, Jaeger, Grafana)
2. **OpenTelemetry Configuration**: Set up Otel-Collector configuration to route telemetry data appropriately
3. **AKS Deployment**: Deploy the complete stack to AKS cluster
4. **Kustomize Configuration**: Create environment-specific overlays for FT environment deployment
5. **CI/CD Integration**: Update pipeline definitions to include deployment automation
6. **Integration Testing**: Validate component intercommunication and data flow
7. **Documentation**: Update deployment and operational documentation

## Expected Outcome
- Fully functional observability stack providing comprehensive insights into application performance
- Automated deployment process through CI/CD pipeline
- Loki successfully collecting and storing application logs
- Integrated dashboard views in Grafana for unified observability
- Production-ready observability infrastructure in FT environment

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] Changes successfully merged to main branch
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployment validated in FT environment
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured for the observability stack itself

## Priority
High

## Estimated Story Points
[To be determined during sprint planning]

## Dependencies
- Existing AKS cluster access and permissions
- Existing Grafana Observability pipeline
- CI/CD pipeline modification capabilities
- Access to FT environment for deployment testing







Description
