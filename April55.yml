Description
Stand up a dedicated Linux VM to temporarily host the OSS observability stack (Grafana, Prometheus, Loki, Jaeger) for the dev environment, with AKS sending telemetry to the VM. Keep access private and time-boxed while ingress issues are resolved.
Expected outcomes
Unblocked visibility: Teams can access observability UIs without changing AKS/APIM.
Minimal risk: Private-only access; limited and controlled exposure.
Operationally simple: Containerized deployment and basic runbook.
Documented deviation: Dev environment exception captured with a clear sunset plan.
Acceptance criteria
VM host running the OSS stack using a containerized approach, reachable within the private network.
Telemetry visible end-to-end from AKS (metrics, logs, traces) in the VM-hosted tools.
Private-only access to UIs (no public exposure); basic auth enabled.
Time-boxed workaround with defined exit criteria and decommission steps.
