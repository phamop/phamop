## Title  
Dev: Implement Temporary VM-hosted OSS Observability Stack

## 1. Description  
- **Problem/Need:**  
  Implement the approved design to deploy a temporary, private VM-hosted OSS observability stack (Grafana, Prometheus, Loki, Jaeger) and wire AKS telemetry via OpenTelemetry Collector, without changing AKS/APIM ingress.

- **Expected Outcome:**  
  Working deployment on a Linux VM using Docker Compose and Ansible, with existing network-only access, short retention, and a brief runbook. Telemetry from AKS is visible end-to-end.

## 2. Implementation Approach  
- **Key Steps:**  
  - Provision VM in the existing subnet; apply firewall/NSG rules for local-only access.  
  - Use Ansible to install Docker, deploy Docker Compose stack (Grafana, Prometheus with remote write receiver, Loki, Jaeger), configure restart policies.  
  - Configure OpenTelemetry Collector in AKS to forward metrics (remote write), logs (Loki HTTP), and traces (OTLP) to the VM.  
  - Apply credentials, RBAC, and disable anonymous access; set retention in Prometheus/Loki per design.  
  - Validate telemetry flow and UI access; create a short runbook for common tasks and troubleshooting.  
  - Version compose files and Ansible playbooks in the repo; record decommission/sunset steps.

## 3. Value & Priority  
- **Impact:**  
  Restores developer observability rapidly with minimal risk and clear rollback path.
