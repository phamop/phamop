Weekly Status Report – [Date Range]  

**Team,**  

Here’s a summary of my key deliverables and collaborations this week:  

### **1. Qlik Sense Database Migration to Dedicated Server**  
- Engaged with the Qlik vendor to validate support requirements and ensure a smooth migration path.  
- Coordinated pre-migration checks (backups, connectivity, permissions) for the dedicated server environment.  

### **2. GitLab Upgrade to v17.7.7 in DEV**  
- Successfully upgraded GitLab in the DEV environment.  
- Partnered with DevOps to perform extensive validation, focusing on:  
  - OpenSSL v3 compatibility testing.  
  - Pipeline functionality post-upgrade.  

### **3. RHEV to Hyper-V Cutover Participation**  
- Assisted in migration planning and execution tasks (e.g., VM validations, downtime coordination).  
- Addressed pre-cutover dependency checks.  

**Next Steps:**  
- Finalize Qlik DB migration timeline and rollback plan.  
- Schedule GitLab upgrades for higher environments (TEST/PROD) pending DEV sign-off.  
- Support Hyper-V cutover documentation and post-migration reviews.  

**Blockers/Risks:**  
- [List any, e.g., "Pending vendor confirmation on Qlik licensing for the new server."]
