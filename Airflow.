The application has two Kubernetes services: a ClusterIP for internal traffic and a LoadBalancer to allow Azure services like APIM to access the ingress controller. However, the microservice is currently mapped only to the ClusterIP, which suggests that its external exposure via APIM is happening indirectly. The identified gap is a missing or unclear routing configuration between the Ingress controller and APIM, as the service itself is not directly exposed externally

There is an ongoing session regarding this issue, but it remains unresolved. We are still awaiting an update since configuring the AKS ingress, as we are currently unable to access the Grafana URL as expected
