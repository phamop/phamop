Here’s a structured email draft to inform your DevOps team about the required checks for permissions, role assignments, and implementation details for the Azure monitoring setup with OpenTelemetry, Grafana, and CI/CD deployment:

**Subject:** Action Required: Pre-Implementation Review for Azure Monitoring Stack (App Insights, Grafana, OpenTelemetry)  

**Hi Team,**  

As part of the upcoming implementation of **Azure Monitor + OpenTelemetry + Grafana** for metrics, logs, and traces (via CI/CD Helm deployment), we need to ensure proper **permissions, role assignments, and security compliance** before rollout.  

### **Key Components to Validate:**  
1. **Azure RBAC & Permissions**  
   - Confirm `Contributor`/`Monitoring Contributor` roles for:  
     - **App Insights** (metrics/traces)  
     - **Azure Monitor** (logs)  
     - **Key Vault** (secret access for OpenTelemetry/Grafana).  
   - *Audit Requirement*: Least-privilege principle for service principals.  

2. **Federated Identity Credentials (OIDC)**  
   - Verify GitHub Actions/Azure Pipelines integration with **Azure AD Workload Identity** for:  
     - Key Vault access (external secrets).  
     - Helm deployment permissions (AKS/ARC clusters).  
   - Reference: [Azure Workload Identity Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/workload-identities/).  

3. **OpenTelemetry Configuration**  
   - Validate `OTEL_EXPORTER_*` env vars (e.g., `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`) align with App Insights connection strings.  
   - Ensure SDK (e.g., Java/Python) supports **SSLv3/TLS 1.2+** (compatibility check).  

4. **Grafana Helm Chart (CI/CD)**  
   - Confirm Helm values include:  
     - **Azure Managed Identity** for data source auth (avoid hardcoded secrets).  
     - **Key Vault CSI Driver** for secret injection (if applicable).  
   - Test in **non-prod** before promotion.  

5. **Key Vault Secrets**  
   - Secrets required:  
     - `AppInsights-InstrumentationKey`  
     - `Grafana-ServiceAccount-Token`  
     - `OTLP-Endpoint-Credentials`.  
   - **Access Policy**: Restrict to federated identities + AKS nodes.  

### **Action Items:**  
- **Owners**:  
  - DevOps: Validate RBAC/Helm setup ([@TeamMember]).  
  - Security: Audit federated identity scope ([@SecurityTeam]).  
  - Devs: Test OpenTelemetry SDK compatibility ([@DevLead]).  
- **Deadline**: [DD/MM/YYYY].  

### **References:**  
- [Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/opentelemetry/)  
- [Grafana Helm Chart](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts)  

**Let’s discuss in [Standup/Meeting] on [Date]**. Reply with updates/blockers.  

**Thanks,**  
[Your Name]  
[Your Role]

### **Why This Works:**  
1. **Clear Ownership**: Assigns tasks to specific roles (DevOps/Security/Devs).  
2. **Security Focus**: Highlights federated identity and least-privilege.  
3. **CI/CD Ready**: Links Helm and OIDC best practices.  
4. **Audit Trail**: Documents critical secrets/RBAC for compliance.  

Adjust **bolded** placeholders as needed. For urgency, add a **Timeline** section (e.g., *"Testing must complete by [date] to meet PCI audit"*).
