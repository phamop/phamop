**Subject:** Update on Qlik Case #900123 – Configuration Issue & Next Steps  

**Dear [Manager's Name],**  

I wanted to provide an update regarding our ongoing case with Qlik Support (#900123).  

**Current Status:**  
- Our objective was to obtain the database configuration details or locate the relevant documentation/article, but we have not received a resolution despite multiple exchanges.  
- This morning, Qlik Support sent a Zoom link to schedule a troubleshooting session. However, Zoom is blocked in our environment, making this approach unfeasible.  
- While we can connect to Qlik Sense, we continue to encounter issues that require deeper investigation.  

**Next Steps:**  
- Eric and I have scheduled time today to review the issue before DR operations commence.  
- We will explore alternative solutions, such as using an approved conferencing tool (e.g., Teams) if further collaboration with Qlik is needed.  

**Action Requested:**  
If you have any additional insights or contacts at Qlik who could expedite resolution, please let us know. Otherwise, we will proceed with our plan and keep you updated.  

Thank you for your support.  

**Best regards,**  
[Your Full Name]  
[Your Position]  
[Your Contact Information]
