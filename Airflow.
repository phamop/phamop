We appreciate the support youâ€™ve provided so far, particularly the helpful documentation that enabled us to successfully migrate Qlik Sense to a dedicated database.

We are now looking to migrate NPrinting to a dedicated database as well. Could you kindly share relevant documentation or an article similar to the one provided for Qlik Sense? This would greatly assist us in ensuring a smooth and successful migration.

Thank you in advance for your assistance.
