I'll rewrite that message to make it clearer and more professional:

"The Disaster Recovery (DR) activities were successful, with all critical components working as expected and validated by the Data Analyst team. 

However, we encountered an unexpected license issue with NPrinting during post-recovery validation.

Action: A vendor support case (#0000904567) has been opened with complete details to address the NPrinting license issue."
