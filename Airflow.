Thank you for sharing the link. We have successfully migrated our database to the dedicated server. However, we are encountering an issue when enabling encryptionâ€”the application fails to establish a connection.

Could you kindly provide us with a relevant article or documentation to guide us in properly enabling encryption and restoring seamless communication with the application?

We appreciate your support.
