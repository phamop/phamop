We’re excited to share that we’ve successfully deployed the External Secrets Operator (ESO) in our environment, leveraging Federated Identity Credentials (FIC) backed by Microsoft Entra ID for authentication.

Key Benefits:
✅ Eliminates long-lived secrets: No more manual rotation or exposure risks of static credentials.
✅ Secure by design: Uses short-lived, auto-rotated tokens via Microsoft’s identity platform.
✅ Compliance-friendly: Aligns with zero-trust principles and audit requirements (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001).

This approach simplifies secret management while enhancing security. We’d appreciate your formal consent to adopt this as our standard for secret management.

Next Steps:
Review: Documentation/architecture is available [link to Confluence/SharePoint].
