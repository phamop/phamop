Thank you for your ongoing support. The documentation you previously shared for migrating Qlik Sense to a dedicated database was extremely helpful, and we successfully completed the process.

We are now planning to migrate NPrinting to a dedicated database and would appreciate it if you could provide similar documentation or guidance for this product. This will help ensure a smooth and efficient transition.

Thank you in advance for your assistance.
