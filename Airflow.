It seems, my ask is not clear enough. I need to change  the current Db connection to new DB connection.
And I need to know the location where that configuration need to be made.
I have tested  the newDB and I have validated both connection and credentials. 
This is my ask. Any guidance to resolve this will greatly be appreciated. Even if you would like to send a link for screen sharing that will be alright as well..
