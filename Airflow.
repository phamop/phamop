As part of the upcoming GitLab upgrade to version 17.7, there will be a mandatory change requiring all communications to use SSLv3 for enhanced security. This update may impact existing integrations, pipelines, or services that do not currently support SSLv3.

Next Steps:
Review your systems (CI/CD pipelines, integrations, API calls, etc.) to ensure compatibility with SSLv3.

Test in staging (if available) before the production rollout.

Report any blockers by [deadline, e.g., DD/MM/YYYY] so we can address them proactively.

Key Details:
Change Date: [Insert planned deployment date]

Affected Components: [List specific services if known, e.g., GitLab runners, container registries, webhooks]

Documentation Reference: [Link to GitLab’s SSLv3 requirements or internal docs]

Please reply to this thread with updates or concerns by [deadline]. Let’s coordinate in [standup/meeting] if further discussion is needed.
