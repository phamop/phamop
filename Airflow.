TI’m pleased to confirm that the DR activities were completed successfully with all critical systems restored as planned.

However, we encountered an unexpected licensing issue with NPrinting post-recovery. Here’s the current status:

Issue Identified: NPrinting services are failing due to an invalid or expired license.

Action Taken: A vendor case has been opened (Case #09123456) with full details, including logs and error screenshots.

Vendor Response: Awaiting their initial assessment (expected timeline: [X hours/days]).

Next Steps:

Vendor Follow-Up: Eric and I will escalate the case if no resolution is provided by [deadline].

Contingency Plan: We’re exploring temporary workarounds to minimize business impact (e.g., manual report generation if feasible).

Request: If you have any vendor contacts who could expedite the resolution, please let us know. Otherwise, we’ll keep you updated on progress.

Thank you for your support.
