It seems my previous request wasn’t clear enough. To clarify, I need to:

Change the current database connection to a new one.

Identify the exact configuration file/location where this change needs to be made.

I’ve already tested the new database connection and confirmed that both the connection and credentials are working properly.

Could you please provide guidance on how to proceed? If it’s easier, I’m also open to a screen-sharing session or any reference documentation to help resolve this.

Your support would be greatly appreciated!
