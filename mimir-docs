## 4. Azure Blob Storage Cost Analysis

### 4.1 Production Environment Costs

#### Storage Requirements Calculation
- **Ingestion Rate**: 100,000 samples/sec
- **Sample Size**: ~24 bytes per sample (compressed)
- **Daily Storage**: 100,000 × 24 × 86,400 = ~207 GB/day
- **Monthly Storage**: 207 × 30 = ~6.2 TB/month
- **90-day Retention**: 6.2 × 3 = ~18.6 TB total

#### Monthly Costs (USD) - Production
| Component | Specification | Monthly Cost |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Hot Blob Storage** | 2 TB (recent data) | $40.96 |
| **Cool Blob Storage** | 16.6 TB (older data) | $166.00 |
| **Transaction Costs** | PUT/GET operations | $25.00 |
| **Data Transfer** | Outbound data | $15.00 |
| **Metadata Storage** | 100 GB | $2.05 |
| **Total Production** | | **$248.01** |

### 4.2 Development Environment Costs

#### Storage Requirements Calculation
- **Ingestion Rate**: 10,000 samples/sec
- **Sample Size**: ~24 bytes per sample (compressed)
- **Daily Storage**: 10,000 × 24 × 86,400 = ~20.7 GB/day
- **Monthly Storage**: 20.7 × 30 = ~620 GB/month
- **30-day Retention**: 620 GB total

#### Monthly Costs (USD) - Development
| Component | Specification | Monthly Cost |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Hot Blob Storage** | 620 GB | $12.71 |
| **Transaction Costs** | PUT/GET operations | $3.00 |
| **Data Transfer** | Outbound data | $2.00 |
| **Metadata Storage** | 10 GB | $0.21 |
| **Total Development** | | **$17.92** |
