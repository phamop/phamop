I hope this email finds you well.

During our recent Qlik migration, we encountered a licensing issue that was resolved with the help of Qlik Support. However, the support team noted that certain aspects of our deployment—specifically, custom role configurations and port settings—fall outside the scope of standard support and require assistance from Professional Services.

To proceed, we’d like to engage Qlik’s Professional Services team for the following:

Role Customization: Review and optimize our custom security/access roles.

Port Configuration: Validate and adjust port settings for our environment.

Could you please:

Confirm the process to engage Professional Services?

Provide an estimated timeline and cost structure for this support?

Share any prerequisites (e.g., documentation, access requirements)?

We aim to complete these configurations promptly to ensure a fully optimized deployment. Let us know if you need additional details from our team.
