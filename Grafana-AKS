monitors and collects telemetry signals (metrics, logs, traces) from the following components, depending on how you configured the CRD (OpenTelemetryCollector) and receivers:

1. Kubernetes / Node-Level Components

Kubelet & API Server metrics (via Prometheus receiver scraping endpoints like /metrics)

cAdvisor / container runtime metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network usage per pod/container)

Kube-state-metrics (cluster object state: deployments, pods, nodes, jobs, etc.)

2. Application Workloads

OTLP receiver collects traces, metrics, and logs directly from instrumented applications (using SDKs or auto-instrumentation).

Jaeger receiver accepts spans if workloads are already exporting traces in Jaeger format.

Prometheus receiver scrapes metrics endpoints exposed by apps and services.

Loki / Fluentbit integration (if configured) collects logs from pods.


Operator, the otel-collector usually monitors Kubernetes cluster state, node/pod/container metrics, application traces/logs, and service-specific metricsâ€”all unified under one pipeline that you configure in the CRD.
