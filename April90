                                                      ↓
Frontend Apps → OpenTelemetry SDK → OTel Collector
```

### Tier 2: Processing Layer
```
OTel Collector (with processors):
├── Logs → Loki
├── Metrics → Prometheus
└── Traces → Jaeger
```

### Tier 3: Visualization Layer
```
Grafana (unified dashboards):
├── Loki data source (logs)
├── Prometheus data source (metrics)
└── Jaeger data source (traces)
```

## Best Practices

### For Each Component:

1. **Implement Correlation IDs** across all components
2. **Use structured logging** with consistent schemas
3. **Configure appropriate sampling** to manage volume and costs
4. **Set up alerting** on key business and technical metrics
5. **Create unified dashboards** in Grafana for end-to-end visibility

### Critical Configuration:

- **OTel Collector**: Configure batch processors, retry mechanisms, and resource detection
- **Sampling Strategies**: Implement head-based sampling for traces, log level filtering
- **Data Retention**: Configure appropriate retention policies for each data type
- **Security**: Implement proper authentication and authorization for all components

## Cost Optimization

1. **Use Azure Monitor for critical paths** (Front Door, APIM, App Gateway)
2. **OSS stack for detailed analysis** and custom requirements
3. **Implement intelligent sampling** to reduce data volume
4. **Archive older data** to cheaper storage tiers
