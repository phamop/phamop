**Secure Infrastructure and Architecture** | • **Network Policies:** **Calico** or **Cilium** policies are critical to restrict traffic. To allow only the OSS component to communicate the necessary endpoint such remote write endpoint, and only allow Grafana to query Prometheus/Loki.<br>• **Policy Enforcement:** Use **OPA/Gatekeeper** to enforce policies like "all Prometheus pods must have a 'readonly' root filesystem" or "Grafana must only use specific image registries."<br>• **Isolation:** Deploy the observability stack to a dedicated namespace - **monitoring** with strict RBAC limits. |

**Compliance & Auditability** | Ensures the platform adheres to industry standards and regulations. | Standardized, secure, and auditable configuration. | • Enforcement of CIS AKS baseline policies.<br>• Use of OPA Gatekeeper and Azure Policy.<br>• Blob Write Once, Read Many (WORM) storage for immutable audit logs. |
