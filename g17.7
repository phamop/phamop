# Subject: Follow-up: GitLab Upgrade OpenSSL 3 Configuration Review - Impact Assessment

Dear [Team/Stakeholders],

I'm writing to follow up on our discussion regarding the upcoming GitLab upgrade that will transition to OpenSSL 3. Before proceeding with deployment in our lower environments, I wanted to provide a comprehensive review of potential impacts and recommended mitigation strategies.

## OpenSSL 3 Migration Impact Assessment

### Key Changes in OpenSSL 3
- **Deprecated Algorithms**: Several legacy algorithms are now deprecated or removed, including:
  - MD2, MD4, MD5 (for TLS)
  - DES, IDEA, SEED, RC4, RC5
  - SSLv2, SSLv3
- **Default Security Level**: OpenSSL 3 enforces a higher default security level (1), which may reject certificates and connections that were previously accepted
- **FIPS Compliance**: New FIPS provider implementation with stricter compliance requirements
- **API Changes**: Some internal API changes that could affect custom integrations

### Potential Impact Areas

1. **Custom Certificates**: 
   - Certificates using MD5/SHA-1 signatures may no longer be trusted
   - RSA keys smaller than 2048 bits may be rejected
   - Self-signed certificates with weak parameters may fail validation

2. **Integration Points**:
   - GitLab integrations with external systems using legacy encryption
   - CI/CD pipelines with custom SSL configurations
   - Docker registry connections with legacy cipher suites
   - Legacy LDAP configurations with outdated encryption settings

3. **Custom Scripts/Applications**:
   - Any custom scripts directly using OpenSSL libraries
   - Legacy applications interacting with GitLab API
   - Automation tools with hardcoded cipher preferences

## Recommended Pre-Deployment Actions

1. **Inventory Collection**:
   - Identify all custom certificates in use across environments
   - Document all integration points and their SSL/TLS configurations
   - Catalog any custom scripts that interact with cryptographic functions

2. **Certificate Validation**:
   - Validate all certificates against OpenSSL 3 requirements (using the openssl verify command)
   - Renew any certificates using deprecated algorithms or key sizes
   - Update self-signed certificates to use modern parameters

3. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Deploy OpenSSL 3 in an isolated test environment first
   - Prioritize testing of all identified integration points
   - Create specific test cases for each potential impact area
   - Implement parallel testing where possible to compare behaviors

4. **Rollback Plan**:
   - Document complete rollback procedures
   - Create backup of all relevant configurations
   - Establish clear rollback triggers and decision points

## Next Steps

1. I recommend we schedule a technical review meeting with the security and infrastructure teams by [DATE] to finalize our testing approach.

2. Based on our inventory assessment, we should prioritize updating any certificates or configurations that use deprecated algorithms before the upgrade.

3. We should create a detailed testing matrix for the lower environment deployment, with specific focus on integration points.

4. I suggest allocating [TIMEFRAME] for testing in the lower environment before proceeding to production.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about this assessment. I'm available to discuss any technical details in more depth.
