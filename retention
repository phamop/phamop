Summary of Retention Policies
High-Resolution Metrics (Debugging): 30 days

Downsampled Metrics (Trending): 2 years

Application Logs (Auditing): 90 days

Trace Data (Performance): 90 days


Of course. This is an excellent and detailed architecture. Addressing data retention within this setup requires breaking it down by signal type (metrics, logs, traces) as they have different storage backends and retention mechanisms.

Here is a comprehensive analysis of your integration flow with a focus on data retention policies and recommendations.

### Summary of Retention Levers by Component

| Signal Type | Primary Storage (Hot) | Secondary Storage (Warm/Cold) | Retention Control |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Metrics** | Prometheus Local TSDB (VM SSD) | Azure Blob (Thanos Bucket) | Prometheus `storage.tsdb.retention`, Thanos Compaction |
| **Logs** | Loki Ingester (VM Mem/SSD Cache) | Azure Blob (Loki Bucket) | Loki Storage Schemas / Compactor |
| **Traces** | Elastic Cloud (Managed Storage) | (Within Elastic) | Elastic Index Lifecycle Management (ILM) |

---

### 1. Metrics Retention (Prometheus + Thanos)

Your metrics pipeline has a two-tiered retention strategy:

**a) Local Retention on VMSS (Hot/Warm Data):**
*   **Component:** Prometheus local TSDB on Premium SSD (`/data/prometheus`).
*   **Control:** This is governed by the `--storage.tsdb.retention.time` flag in your Prometheus command or configuration.
    *   **Typical Value:** `15d` or `30d` (15-30 days). This defines how long the raw, high-resolution data is kept on the fast, local disks for quick querying by Grafana.
*   **Consideration:** The size of your Premium SSD volume and your ingestion rate will be the limiting factor. You must ensure `disk space > ingestion_rate * retention_days`.

**b) Object Storage Retention with Thanos (Warm/Cold Data):**
*   **Component:** Thanos Sidecar (uploads blocks) -> Azure Blob (Thanos Bucket).
*   **Control:** **Data in the object bucket is immutable and is never deleted by Prometheus or Thanos Sidecar.** Retention is managed by the **Thanos Compactor** component.
*   **How it works:** The Thanos Compactor periodically downloads blocks from the bucket, compacts them (into larger blocks), applies downsampling (creating 5m and 1h resolution data), and **most importantly, enforces retention policies**.
*   **Configuration:** You run the compactor with flags like:
    *   `--retention.resolution-raw=<duration>` (e.g., `30d`)
    *   `--retention.resolution-5m=<duration>` (e.g., `90d`)
    *   `--retention.resolution-1h=<duration>` (e.g., `1y`)
*   **Recommendation:** This is where you define your long-term retention policy (e.g., keep raw data for 30 days, keep downsampled data for 1 year). The compactor automatically deletes blocks that exceed these durations from the Azure Blob bucket.

### 2. Logs Retention (Loki)

Similar to Thanos, Loki uses object storage as its primary durable storage.

*   **Component:** Loki -> Azure Blob (Loki Bucket).
*   **Control:** Retention is managed by Loki itself, specifically by the **Table Manager** (for legacy index) or the **Compactor** (for `boltdb-shipper`), configured in the Loki configuration file.
*   **Configuration:** You define retention rules in a `storage_config` section for the object store and in the `compactor` or `table_manager` section.
    ```yaml
    # Example for boltdb-shipper (recommended)
    compactor:
      working_directory: /data/loki-cache/compactor
      shared_store: azure
      retention_enabled: true
      retention_delete_delay: 2h
      retention_delete_worker_count: 10

    storage_config:
      boltdb_shipper:
        active_index_directory: /data/loki-cache/index
        cache_location: /data/loki-cache/cache
        shared_store: azure
      azure:
        container_name: your-loki-bucket
        # ... connection details

    # This is the key section - define retention periods per tenant (use 'fake' for single tenant)
    schema_config:
      configs:
        - from: 2023-01-01
          store: boltdb-shipper
          object_store: azure
          schema: v13
          index:
            prefix: index_
            period: 24h
          # Retention policy is defined here
          chunks:
            period: 24h
            # Keep data for 30 days
            retain_period: 720h
    ```
*   **How it works:** Loki breaks data into "chunks" and indexes. The compactor periodically scans the Azure Blob bucket and deletes any chunks and index entries that are older than the `retain_period` defined in the schema.

### 3. Traces Retention (Jaeger -> Elasticsearch)

*   **Component:** Jaeger Collector -> **Elastic Cloud on Azure**.
*   **Control:** Retention is **not managed by Jaeger**. It is 100% controlled by **Elasticsearch's Index Lifecycle Management (ILM)** policies.
*   **How it works:** Jaeger writes trace data to Elasticsearch indices (e.g., `jaeger-span-2024-05-27`). You must define an ILM policy in Elasticsearch that:
    1.  Rolls over indices when they reach a certain size or age (e.g., `50GB` or `1d`).
    2.  Moves older indices to slower, cheaper tiers of storage (if you have them configured in Elastic Cloud).
    3.  **Deletes indices after a specified `min_age`** (e.g., `30d`).
*   **Recommendation:** Configure this directly in your Elastic Cloud console or via Elasticsearch's API. This is the most efficient way to manage trace retention as it's handled by the database engine itself.

### Key Recommendations and Actions

1.  **Define Your Organizational Policy First:** Before configuring anything, decide:
    *   How long do we need **high-resolution metrics** for debugging? (e.g., 30 days)
    *   How long do we need **downsampled metrics** for long-term trend analysis? (e.g., 2 years)
    *   How long must **application logs** be kept for auditing and investigation? (e.g., 90 days)
    *   How long must **trace data** be kept for performance analysis? (e.g., 30 days)

2.  **Configure Thanos Compactor:** Ensure your Thanos Compactor deployment is running and configured with the `--retention.*` flags that match your metrics policy.

3.  **Explicitly Configure Loki Retention:** Do not rely on defaults. Explicitly define the `retain_period` in your Loki `schema_config` as shown in the example above.

4.  **Set Up Elasticsearch ILM:** Log into your Elastic Cloud deployment and create a clear ILM policy for the Jaeger indices. This is a critical step; without it, your trace storage will grow indefinitely.

5.  **Monitor Storage Consumption:**
    *   **Azure Blob:** Set up alerts on the blob containers (`thanos-bucket`, `loki-bucket`) for storage capacity. Use lifecycle management rules in the blob storage account as a **safety net** to automatically delete old data if your primary mechanisms (Thanos Compactor, Loki) fail, but be very careful with the rules to avoid conflicts.
    *   **VMSS SSDs:** Monitor disk space on `/data` for Prometheus, Loki cache, and Thanos cache. Alert on high usage.
    *   **Elastic Cloud:** Use the built-in monitoring in Elastic Cloud to track index growth and storage usage.

By addressing each component's specific retention levers, you can ensure your observability data is kept for as long as it provides value without incurring unnecessary storage costs or risking system instability.




























Summary: Retention Process

Two-tiered retention strategy:
1.  Hot/Warm Storage (Short-Term): Local Premium SSDs on the VMSS for fast querying of recent data.
2.  Cold/Long-Term Storage (Long-Term): Azure Blob Storage, which is durable, scalable, and cost-effective.

The retention is not controlled by a single "database" setting but by a combination of configurations in Prometheus, Loki, Thanos, and your tracing backend.

 1. Metrics Retention (Prometheus + Thanos)

This is the most complex retention flow in your setup.

 Component | Role & Retention Control |

Prometheus (on VMSS) - Hot Storage.
Its primary job is to scrape and store the most recent data. Retention is controlled by the `--storage.tsdb.retention.time` flag (e.g., `2d` for 2 days). After this period, it deletes old blocks from the local `/data/prometheus` SSD. 
Thanos Sidecar
 | Watches the local Prometheus TSDB. As soon as Prometheus creates a new 2-hour block (compacted from raw data), the Thanos Sidecar uploads it immutable block to the Azure Blob (thanos-bucket). This is the ingestion point into long-term storage. |
Thanos Compactor Manages Long-Term Retention & Downsampling. 
This is a critical job. It runs in the background on the Azure Blob bucket. 
 â€¢ Applies Retention: You configure retention in the Compactor (e.g., `--retention.resolution-raw=30d --retention.resolution-5m=90d --retention.resolution-1h=1y`). 
This defines how long to keep detailed (raw) data, 5m downsampled data, and 1h downsampled data. 
Downsamples: Creates smaller, aggregated data blocks (5m, 1h resolution) to make querying years of data efficient. 

Azure Blob Storage 
 The Source of Truth. This is where all metric data ultimately resides. Its retention is managed entirely by Thanos. The Compactor is the only process that should delete data from the bucket based on its rules. You can also set Azure Blob immutability policies or lifecycle rules for compliance, but this is usually unnecessary as Thanos manages it. |

Key Takeaway: Metric retention is set in Prometheus (short-term) and the Thanos Compactor (long-term). The `thanos-bucket` is the durable store.

2. Logs Retention (Loki)

Loki's retention is more straightforward and is managed centrally.

| Component | Role & Retention Control |

 Loki Ingester (on VMSS) | Hot Storage. Receives logs and writes them to "tenant" indexes on the local `/data/loki-cache` SSD for very recent data (typically just a few hours).
Loki Compactor 
 Manages Long-Term Retention. Similar to Thanos, this is a crucial background process. 
 Applies Retention: You configure a retention period in the Loki configuration file for the compactor (e.g., `retention_period: 720h` / 30 days).  
 Deletes Data: The compactor periodically scans the `loki-bucket` in Azure Blob and permanently deletes any chunks and index entries that are older than the configured period. 
 Azure Blob Storage - The Source of Truth. 
All log chunks and indexes are stored here via the `boltdb-shipper` mode. Retention is managed entirely by Loki's compactor. You can use Azure's native blob lifecycle management policies as a backup or for enforcing strict, irreversible deletion after a certain period. 

Key Takeaway: Log retention is primarily set in the Loki configuration for the compactor. The `loki-bucket` is the durable store.

3. Traces Retention (Jaeger + Elastic/OpenSearch)

Your trace retention is fundamentally different because it relies on an external database.

| Component | Role & Retention Control |

Jaeger Collector | Ingestion Agent. 
It receives traces and does not store them itself. It immediately writes them to the configured storage backend (Elastic Cloud or OpenSearch VMSS). 
It has no retention settings. |
Elasticsearch / OpenSearch -
 The Database & Retention Engine. This is where all trace data is stored and where retention is controlled. 
 Using Index Lifecycle Management (ILM): This is the standard method. You define a policy that rolls indices from "hot" (fast, recent data) to "warm"/"cold" (less frequent querying) and finally to "delete" after a specified period (e.g., 30 days, 1 year). 
 This is a separate, critical configuration within your Elastic/OpenSearch cluster. 
| Jaeger Query | Just a UI/Query Interface. It queries the storage backend but does not manage any data retention itself. 

Key Takeaway: Trace retention is not managed by Jaeger. It is configured entirely within your Elasticsearch or OpenSearch deployment using ILM policies.

 Critical Recommendations and Action Items

1.  Document Your Retention Policies: Clearly define how long you need to keep each data type (e.g., 30 days for detailed metrics, 1 year for downsampled metrics, 90 days for logs, 30 days for traces). Document the business or compliance reason for each.
2.  Configure the Compactors: The Thanos Compactor and Loki Compactor are the most important components for managing cost and storage. Their configuration files are where you will implement your defined retention policies. Do not leave them with default values.
3.  Secure Your Azure Blob Buckets: Ensure the `thanos-bucket` and `loki-bucket` have appropriate firewall rules and are not publicly accessible. Use Managed Identity for access wherever possible.
4.  Monitor Your Storage Growth: Even with retention policies, you must monitor the size of your Azure Blob containers and your Elasticsearch cluster. Set up alerts for unexpected growth.
5.  Test Deletion: In a non-production environment, verify that your retention settings work correctly. 
Ingest data, wait for the period to expire, and confirm the compactor processes delete the old data as expected. This prevents costly surprises.

In essence, your "database retention" is a policy enforced by the compactor components (Thanos, Loki) on Azure Blob Storage for metrics and logs, and by Index Lifecycle Management on your chosen trace database.
