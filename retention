Of course. This is a well-architected but complex observability platform. The core data retention and lifecycle management is governed by the interaction between the components. Let's break down the retention for each data type (Metrics, Logs, Traces) and address the key components you've listed.

### Summary: Retention Philosophy

Your architecture uses a **two-tiered retention strategy**:
1.  **Hot/Warm Storage (Short-Term):** Local Premium SSDs on the VMSS for fast querying of recent data.
2.  **Cold/Long-Term Storage (Long-Term):** Azure Blob Storage, which is durable, scalable, and cost-effective.

The retention is not controlled by a single "database" setting but by a combination of configurations in Prometheus, Loki, Thanos, and your tracing backend.

### 1. Metrics Retention (Prometheus + Thanos)

This is the most complex retention flow in your setup.

| Component | Role & Retention Control |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Prometheus** (on VMSS) | **Hot Storage.** Its primary job is to scrape and store the **most recent data**. Retention is controlled by the `--storage.tsdb.retention.time` flag (e.g., `2d` for 2 days). After this period, it deletes old blocks from the local `/data/prometheus` SSD. |
| **Thanos Sidecar** | Watches the local Prometheus TSDB. As soon as Prometheus creates a new 2-hour block (compacted from raw data), the Thanos Sidecar **uploads it immutable block** to the **Azure Blob (thanos-bucket)**. This is the ingestion point into long-term storage. |
| **Thanos Compactor** | **Manages Long-Term Retention & Downsampling.** This is a critical job. It runs in the background on the Azure Blob bucket. <br> • **Applies Retention:** You configure retention in the Compactor (e.g., `--retention.resolution-raw=30d --retention.resolution-5m=90d --retention.resolution-1h=1y`). This defines how long to keep detailed (raw) data, 5m downsampled data, and 1h downsampled data. <br> • **Downsamples:** Creates smaller, aggregated data blocks (5m, 1h resolution) to make querying years of data efficient. |
| **Azure Blob Storage** | **The Source of Truth.** This is where all metric data ultimately resides. Its retention is **managed entirely by Thanos**. The Compactor is the only process that should delete data from the bucket based on its rules. You can also set Azure Blob immutability policies or lifecycle rules for compliance, but this is usually unnecessary as Thanos manages it. |

**Key Takeaway:** Metric retention is set in **Prometheus** (short-term) and the **Thanos Compactor** (long-term). The `thanos-bucket` is the durable store.

### 2. Logs Retention (Loki)

Loki's retention is more straightforward and is managed centrally.

| Component | Role & Retention Control |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Loki Ingester** (on VMSS) | **Hot Storage.** Receives logs and writes them to **"tenant" indexes** on the local `/data/loki-cache` SSD for very recent data (typically just a few hours). |
| **Loki Compactor** | **Manages Long-Term Retention.** Similar to Thanos, this is a crucial background process. <br> • **Applies Retention:** You configure a retention period in the Loki configuration file for the compactor (e.g., `retention_period: 720h` / 30 days). <br> • **Deletes Data:** The compactor periodically scans the `loki-bucket` in Azure Blob and **permanently deletes** any chunks and index entries that are older than the configured period. |
| **Azure Blob Storage** | **The Source of Truth.** All log chunks and indexes are stored here via the `boltdb-shipper` mode. Retention is **managed entirely by Loki's compactor**. You can use Azure's native blob lifecycle management policies as a backup or for enforcing strict, irreversible deletion after a certain period. |

**Key Takeaway:** Log retention is primarily set in the **Loki configuration** for the compactor. The `loki-bucket` is the durable store.

### 3. Traces Retention (Jaeger + Elastic/OpenSearch)

Your trace retention is fundamentally different because it relies on an external database.

| Component | Role & Retention Control |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Jaeger Collector** | **Ingestion Agent.** It receives traces and does not store them itself. It immediately writes them to the configured storage backend (**Elastic Cloud** or **OpenSearch VMSS**). It has no retention settings. |
| **Elasticsearch / OpenSearch** | **The Database & Retention Engine.** This is where all trace data is stored and where retention is controlled. <br> • **Using Index Lifecycle Management (ILM):** This is the standard method. You define a policy that rolls indices from "hot" (fast, recent data) to "warm"/"cold" (less frequent querying) and finally to "delete" after a specified period (e.g., 30 days, 1 year). <br> • **This is a separate, critical configuration** within your Elastic/OpenSearch cluster. |
| **Jaeger Query** | **Just a UI/Query Interface.** It queries the storage backend but does not manage any data retention itself. |

**Key Takeaway:** Trace retention is **not managed by Jaeger**. It is configured entirely within your **Elasticsearch or OpenSearch** deployment using ILM policies.

### Critical Recommendations and Action Items

1.  **Document Your Retention Policies:** Clearly define how long you need to keep each data type (e.g., 30 days for detailed metrics, 1 year for downsampled metrics, 90 days for logs, 30 days for traces). Document the business or compliance reason for each.
2.  **Configure the Compactors:** The **Thanos Compactor** and **Loki Compactor** are the most important components for managing cost and storage. Their configuration files are where you will implement your defined retention policies. Do not leave them with default values.
3.  **Secure Your Azure Blob Buckets:** Ensure the `thanos-bucket` and `loki-bucket` have appropriate firewall rules and are not publicly accessible. Use Managed Identity for access wherever possible.
4.  **Monitor Your Storage Growth:** Even with retention policies, you must monitor the size of your Azure Blob containers and your Elasticsearch cluster. Set up alerts for unexpected growth.
5.  **Test Deletion:** In a non-production environment, verify that your retention settings work correctly. Ingest data, wait for the period to expire, and confirm the compactor processes delete the old data as expected. This prevents costly surprises.

In essence, your "database retention" is a policy enforced by the **compactor** components (Thanos, Loki) on **Azure Blob Storage** for metrics and logs, and by **Index Lifecycle Management** on your chosen trace database.
