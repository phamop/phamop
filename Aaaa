It's not because the VMs will auto scale that the apps (which will be running using docker) will seamlessly auto scale as well. Have we considered an azure container app or web app if scaling is a requirement? Since everything we're deploying is via container images, we can skip the VM altogether and manage the apps via a PaaS instead of IaaS. Apps inside a VM will scale assuming configuration with LB/networking and they must be stateless, and also the fact that apps run in docker also adds an extra complexity because docker containers runs in a docker network which is not bridged to the host by default, so when the VM will scales, based on what I see here, this will not be trivial. This is probably why azure web apps and container apps exists, simplify container orchestration with scale in mind
