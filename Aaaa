Description

Gather all necessary configuration details and requirements for the target Dedicated AKS cluster to ensure a compatible and secure observability deployment.
Specific technology that  will be share during implementation such Certificate issuer, ingress controller, group sync.

2. Workflow & Implementation Details
Refactor  the current codebase (likely Helm charts/Kustomize) to understand the architecture, identify improvements, and ensure best practices.
Transition from a default or less efficient Jaeger deployment strategy to a production-optimized mode; Transition from allinone default to production mode with elasticsearch storage and transition from memory to External Storage Backend: Elasticsearch
3. Business Value & Priority
Why does this work matter?  Technical impact.
Class of Service
Standard â€“ Regular backlog work.
4. Definition of Done & Validation
Completion Requirements: 
Collecting all relevant information prior to deployment of Dedicated AKS.

 Reusable of the  existing code; Optimized jaeger component to the new design/Implementation

Identifying the specific technology that will be share with the implementation such Certificate issuer, ingress controller, group sync
Testing & Verification: Reviewed and Verified by team
