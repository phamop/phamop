1. Description
Gather all necessary configuration details and requirements to ensure a seamless, secure, and compatible deployment of our observability stack, with a specific focus on refactoring and optimizing the Jaeger tracing component

2. Implementation Approach
Shared Technology Integration:
    Certificate Issuer: Identify the solution (e.g., cert-manager, public/private CA) and required annotations for automatic TLS certificate provisioning.
    Ingress Controller: Determine the specific ingress controller (e.g., NGINX, Azure AGIC, Traefik) and its configuration namespace and annotations.
    Group Sync & RBAC: Document the method for integrating AKS with Azure Active Directory (or other identity provider) for group synchronization. Map Azure AD groups to Kubernetes `RoleBindings` and `ClusterRoleBindings` for access control to observability tools.
  Jaeger Optimization & Transition: Transition from the default, POC `allInOne` deployment strategy (using in-memory storage). Implement a production-optimized, highly available strategy using the `production` deployment mode.

Analyze the existing Helm charts/Kustomize overlays to understand the current observability architecture and identify technical debt, anti-patterns, and areas for improvement

3. Value & Priority
Proactive discovery of integration points (e.g., RBAC, TLS, secrets) hardens the deployment, reduces the attack surface, and ensures compliance with organizational security policies.

4. Done Criteria
 A document is produced, cataloging all relevant AKS configuration details and the specific implementation details for:
    i   Certificate Issuer
    ii  Ingress Controller
    iii Group Sync & RBAC configuration
Validation:
The discovery document has been reviewed and signed off by the teams member.

### **1. Description: Pre-Implementation Discovery for Secure AKS Observability**

**Objective:** To conduct a comprehensive discovery phase for the upcoming deployment of a Dedicated Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. The goal is to gather all necessary configuration details and requirements to ensure a seamless, secure, and compatible deployment of our observability stack, with a specific focus on refactoring and optimizing the Jaeger tracing component.

This phase will explicitly identify and document the shared technologies and integration points between the platform (AKS) and the observability workloads to prevent misconfiguration and security gaps.

---

### **2. Workflow & Implementation Details**

**Phase 1: Discovery & Information Gathering**
*   **Cluster Configuration:** Document AKS version, network model (CNI vs. Kubenet), network policies, and pod security standards (PSP/OPA).
*   **Shared Technology Integration:**
    *   **Certificate Issuer:** Identify the solution (e.g., cert-manager, public/private CA) and required annotations for automatic TLS certificate provisioning.
    *   **Ingress Controller:** Determine the specific ingress controller (e.g., NGINX, Azure AGIC, Traefik) and its configuration namespace and annotations.
    *   **Group Sync & RBAC:** Document the method for integrating AKS with Azure Active Directory (or other identity provider) for group synchronization. Map Azure AD groups to Kubernetes `RoleBindings` and `ClusterRoleBindings` for access control to observability tools.
*   **Security & Compliance:** Identify secrets management strategy (e.g., Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver), and any compliance requirements for data encryption (at-rest/in-transit).

**Phase 2: Codebase Analysis & Refactoring**
*   **Architectural Review:** Analyze the existing Helm charts/Kustomize overlays to understand the current observability architecture and identify technical debt, anti-patterns, and areas for improvement.
*   **Implement Best Practices:** Refactor the codebase to align with Kubernetes and Helm best practices (e.g., proper use of `values.yaml`, templates, labels, and annotations).
*   **Jaeger Optimization & Transition:**
    *   **Current State:** Transition from the default, development-oriented **`allInOne`** deployment strategy (using in-memory storage).
    *   **Target State:** Implement a production-optimized, highly available strategy using the **`production`** deployment mode.
    *   **Storage Backend:** Migrate tracing data storage from volatile memory to a durable, scalable **Elasticsearch** backend, which may be deployed as a separate stateful component within the cluster or use a managed cloud service.

---

### **3. Business Value & Priority**

*   **Why This Matters:**
    *   **Reliability & Performance:** The optimized Jaeger deployment ensures tracing data is persisted and available, providing critical insights for debugging performance issues in production environments. Eliminates data loss from pod restarts.
    *   **Security & Compliance:** Proactive discovery of integration points (e.g., RBAC, TLS, secrets) hardens the deployment, reduces the attack surface, and ensures compliance with organizational security policies.
    *   **Operational Efficiency:** A well-refactored and documented codebase is easier to maintain, scale, and troubleshoot, reducing long-term operational overhead.
    *   **Foundation for Scale:** The move to Elasticsearch provides a scalable storage backend capable of handling high-volume tracing data from distributed microservices.

*   **Class of Service:** **Standard** – This is regular backlog work that is important for platform maturity and stability but is not currently blocking critical work or responding to an incident.

---

### **4. Definition of Done & Validation**

**Completion Requirements:**

1.  **Discovery Artifact:** A detailed document is produced, cataloging all relevant AKS configuration details and the specific implementation details for:
    *   Certificate Issuer
    *   Ingress Controller
    *   Group Sync & RBAC configuration
2.  **Refactored Codebase:** The existing Helm/Kustomize code has been analyzed, refactored, and validated to follow best practices. The new Jaeger production configuration with Elasticsearch storage is implemented and merged into the appropriate branch.
3.  **Reusability:** The refactored code is modular and reusable for future cluster deployments.

**Testing & Verification:**

*   The discovery document has been **reviewed and signed off** by the infrastructure and security teams.
*   The refactored Helm charts/Kustomize configurations have been **peer-reviewed** and **verified** to deploy successfully in a non-production environment, successfully connecting to the specified Elasticsearch backend.
*   All defined integration points (TLS termination at ingress, secret injection, authentication) are **tested and confirmed** to be functional.

**Final Sign-off:** The work is considered complete when reviewed and verified by the team lead or designated project architect.
