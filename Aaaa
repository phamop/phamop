Of course. Here is the updated security framework table, specifically integrating the mentioned OSS observability tools and highlighting their security considerations within a dedicated AKS cluster.

### **Security Framework for OSS Observability on Dedicated AKS**

This table maps security components to their implementation for a stack comprising **OpenTelemetry Collector, Prometheus, Loki, Jaeger, and Grafana** on AKS.

| Security Component | Implementation with the OSS Observability Stack on AKS |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Data Protection - Data Encryption** | • **In Transit:** **Service Mesh (Istio/Linkerd)** for mTLS between collectors, agents, and storage backends. **cert-manager** automates TLS certs for Grafana and Jaeger ingresses.<br>• **At Rest:** Relies on **Azure Disk Encryption** for persistent volumes holding Prometheus, Loki, and Jaeger data. Application-level encryption is managed by the respective tools' configuration. |
| **Secure Infrastructure and Architecture** | • **Network Policies:** Use **Calico** to restrict traffic. Example: Only allow the `otel-collector` namespace to talk to Prometheus, Loki, and Jaeger ports. Isolate Grafana's ingress.<br>• **Policy Enforcement:** Use **OPA/Gatekeeper** to enforce policies like "all Prometheus pods must have a `readonly` root filesystem" or "Grafana must only use specific data sources."<br>• **IaC:** The entire stack—AKS, networking, and Helm charts for Prometheus, Loki, etc.—is deployed via **Terraform** or **Pulumi**. |
| **Log Management and Auditing** | • **Log Collection:** **Fluent Bit** DaemonSet collects cluster/container logs and forwards them to **Grafana Loki**.<br>• **Audit Trail:** Kubernetes API audit logs are a critical data source sent to **Loki**. **Grafana** dashboards visualize access patterns to the observability stack itself.<br>• **Tool Logs:** The logs of Prometheus, Jaeger, Grafana, and the Otel Collector are also stored in **Loki** for self-monitoring. |
| **Securing Workloads and Applications** | • **Image Security:** Scan Helm charts for **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, `loki-distributed`, etc., in CI/CD using **Trivy** before deployment.<br>• **Runtime Security:** Configure **Falco** rules to alert on suspicious activity within observability pods (e.g., shell execution in a Prometheus container).<br>• **Secrets Management:** Use **HashiCorp Vault** (via CSI Driver) to manage secrets for Grafana data sources, Loki/Prometheus external labels, and Jaeger storage configurations. |
| **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** | • **Cluster Access:** **Azure AD Integration** authenticates users. **Kubernetes RBAC** controls who can access namespaces for the observability tools (e.g., `get pods -n monitoring`).<br>• **Application Access:** **Grafana Authentication** is configured to use Azure AD OAuth or another provider to control user access to dashboards and data.<br>• **Tool-to-Tool Auth:** Prometheus, Loki, and Jaeger are configured with basic auth or TLS for components like the Otel Collector to write data, managed via **Vault** or Kubernetes secrets. |

### **Direct Tool-to-Security Mapping**

| OSS Tool | Primary Security Considerations in AKS |
| :--- | :--- |
| **OpenTelemetry Collector** | • Secure connection (mTLS/TLS) to backends (Prometheus, Loki, Jaeger).<br>• Configuration of sensitive processors (e.g., `filter`). |
| **Prometheus** | • Enable authentication (e.g., basic auth) for the API and remote write endpoints.<br>• Restrict access to its UI via network policies and ingress rules.<br>• Secure persistent volume for time-series data. |
| **Grafana Loki** | • Configure object storage (e.g., Azure Blob) with managed identities for data.<br>• Enable authentication for the write API (used by collectors) and read API (used by Grafana). |
| **Jaeger** | • Secure access to the UI and collector endpoints via ingress and network policies.<br>• Configure secure connections to its storage backend (e.g., Elasticsearch, Cassandra). |
| **Grafana** | • **Primary IAM Gatekeeper:** Set up Azure AD OAuth, SAML, or LDAP integration.<br>• Configure datasource permissions to limit which users can query which data.<br>• Secure the admin credentials and avoid storing secrets in plaintext in dashboards. |
