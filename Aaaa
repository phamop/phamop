2. Operational Complexity and Management

Significant Reduction in Management Overhead: Operational focus shifts from infrastructure maintenance (managing VMs, OS patching) to application deployment and lifecycle management.

Declarative and Version-Controlled Configuration: The entire stack is defined as code using Kustomize or Helm charts. This enables atomic, predictable deployments and rollbacks, ensuring consistency across environments.

Unified Management Plane: All observability components are managed through the unified Kubernetes API (kubectl) and can be integrated into GitOps workflows (e.g., FluxCD, ArgoCD), providing a single, consistent control plane.

Automated Infrastructure Management: The underlying node OS security patching, scaling, and cluster upgrades are managed automatically by Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), reducing the team's operational burden.

Simplified Architecture: This approach presents a single, consolidated observability data plane to manage, which is operationally simpler than managing a separate observability sidecar per application cluster (as in Option B).
