Of course. Here is the table formatted for a wiki, focusing purely on the implementation within AKS without distinguishing between Azure and customer responsibilities.

### **Security Framework for Dedicated AKS Hosting**

This table maps standard security components to their corresponding implementation within a dedicated Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) environment.

| Security Component | Implementation & Corresponding Technologies in AKS |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Data Protection - Data Encryption** | • **At Rest:** Azure Disk Encryption with Service-Managed Keys or Customer-Managed Keys (CMK) from Azure Key Vault. Encrypted Etcd storage for control plane data.<br>• **In Transit:** Service Mesh (Linkerd, Istio) for mutual TLS (mTLS) between pods. TLS termination at the Ingress Controller (e.g., NGINX, AGIC). TLS encryption for all API Server communication. |
| **Secure Infrastructure and Architecture** | • Hardened, Azure-maintained host OS for nodes.<br>• Fully managed and secured control plane (API Server, Scheduler, etcd).<br>• Deployment within a dedicated Azure Virtual Network (VNet).<br>• Network Policies (using Azure Network Policy or Calico) for pod micro-segmentation.<br>• Option for Private Clusters with a non-internet-routable API server. |
| **Log Management and Auditing** | • **Azure Monitor for Containers:** Centralized collection of cluster performance metrics, container logs, and Kubernetes events.<br>• **Kubernetes Audit Logs:** Detailed logging of all interactions with the API server for security auditing.<br>• **Log Analytics Workspace:** Central repository for querying and analyzing all log data using KQL (Kusto Query Language).<br>• **Azure Sentinel Integration:** For SIEM capabilities and advanced security monitoring. |
| **Securing Workloads and Applications** | • **Pod Security Standards (PSS):** Enforcing security contexts to prevent privileged pods or require non-root users.<br>• **Azure Container Registry (ACR):** Private registry with integrated vulnerability scanning via Microsoft Defender for Containers.<br>• **Runtime Threat Detection:** Microsoft Defender for Containers provides alerts for suspicious container activity.<br>• **Secrets Management:** Native Kubernetes Secrets or integration with Azure Key Vault via the Secrets Store CSI Driver. |
| **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** | • **Azure AD Integration:** User authentication against Azure Active Directory.<br>• **Kubernetes RBAC:** Authorization within the cluster based on user identity or group membership.<br>• **Azure RBAC:** Controlling access to manage the AKS cluster resource itself in the Azure portal.<br>• **Managed Identities:** For the cluster and kubelets to authenticate to other Azure services securely.<br>• **Azure Workload Identity:** For applications (pods) to authenticate to Azure services using Azure AD. |
