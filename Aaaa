Applications across various sources send telemetry to the internal ingress endpoint of the dedicated AKS cluster
The NGINX Ingress Controller routes OTLP traffic to the OTel Collector service.
The OTel Collector processes and writes data to the backend services (Prometheus, Loki, Jaeger) running in the same cluster.
Users access the Grafana UI via its public ingress endpoint, authenticating with Azure AD SSO.
Grafana queries the backend services (e.g., Prometheus Query, Loki) internally within the cluster network.
